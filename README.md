ADPCM example for PC-FX
=========================

This shows you how to make use of ADPCM on the PC-FX.
This can also be used as a sound test altho it is primitive for that purpose.

A small abstraction library is also provided in pcfx.c for other stuff like PSG 5-bits 16000hz sound.

If you want to use it as a base for a "murder" simulator like Wolfenstein 3D, you can.
